Welcome to my Cryptopals repository! 

This project is my way of sharpening my C++ skills while diving into the world of cryptography! These challenges can be found at: https://cryptopals.com.

Project is done with **C++17** and bazel **8.0.0**

Repo Breakdown:
- lib/: Reusable helper functions for the challenges. 🛠️
